<h1>OWL</h1>
<img src="wowl.jpeg" alt="owl's neck is tilted and it is staring at something"> 
<br><p> are birds from the order Strigiformes[1] </p>
<p>(/ˈstrɪdʒəfɔːrmiːz/), which includes over 200 species</p>
<p>of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an </p>
<p>upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision,</p>
<p>binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for </p>
<p>silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern </p>
<p>hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.</p>
<p>Owls are divided into two families: the true (or typical) owl </p>
<p>family, Strigidae, and the barn owl and bay owl family, </p>
<p>Tytonidae.[2] Owls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and</p>
<p>other birds, although a few species specialize in hunting fish. </p>
<p>They are found in all regions of the Earth except the polar ice </p>
<p>caps and some remote islands.</p>

<p>A group of owls is called a "parliament".[3]</p>

<h2>ANATOMY</h2>

<p>Owls possess large, forward-facing eyes and ear-holes, a </p>
<p>hawk-like beak, a flat face, and usually a conspicuous circle </p>
<p>of feathers, a facial disc, around each eye. The feathers </p>
<p>making up this disc can be adjusted to sharply focus sounds </p>
<p>from varying distances onto the owls' asymmetrically placed </p>
<p>ear cavities. Most birds of prey have eyes on the sides of </p>
<p>their heads, but the stereoscopic nature of the owl's </p>
<p>forward-facing eyes permits the greater sense of depth </p>
<p>perception necessary for low-light hunting. Owls have </p>
<p>binocular vision, but they must rotate their entire heads to </p>
<p>change the focus of their view because, like most birds, their </p>
<p>eyes are fixed in their sockets. Owls are farsighted and </p>
<p>cannot clearly see anything nearer than a few centimetres </p>
<p>of their eyes. Caught prey can be felt by owls with the use </p>

<br><p>of filoplumes—hairlike feathers on the beak and feet that act </p>
<p>as "feelers". Their far vision, particularly in low light, is </p>
<p>exceptionally good. Owls can rotate their heads and necks as </p>
<p>much as 270°. Owls have 14 neck vertebrae—humans have only </p>
<p>seven—and their vertebral circulatory systems are adapted to </p>
<p>allow them to rotate their heads without cutting off blood to </p>
<p>the brain. Specifically, the foramina in their vertebrae </p>
<p>through which the vertebral arteries pass are about ten times </p>
<p>the diameter of the artery, instead of about the same size as </p>
<p>the artery, as is the case in humans; the vertebral arteries </p>
<p>enter the cervical vertebrae higher than in other birds, giving </p>
<p>the vessels some slack, and the carotid arteries unite in a </p>
<p>very large anastomosis or junction, the largest of any bird's, preventing </p>
<p>supply from being cut off while they rotate their necks. Other anastomoses </p>
<p>between the carotid and vertebral arteries support this effect.[4][5]</p>
<p>The smallest owl—weighing as little as 31 g (1+3⁄32 oz) and</p>
<p>measuring some 13.5 cm (5+1⁄4 in)—is the elf owl (Micrathene </p>
<p>whitneyi).[6] Around the same diminutive length, although </p>
<p>slightly heavier, are the lesser known long-whiskered owlet </p>
<p>(Xenoglaux loweryi) and Tamaulipas pygmy owl </p>
<p>(Glaucidium sanchezi).[6] The largest owls are two </p>
<p>similarly sized species; the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo)</p>
<p>and Blakiston's fish owl (Ketupa blakistoni). The largest</p>
<p>females of these species are 71 cm (28 in) long, have a 190</p>
<p>cm (75 in) wing span, and weigh 4.2 kg (9+1⁄4 lb).</p>
<p>[6][7][8][9][10] Different species of owls produce different</p>
<p>sounds; this distribution of calls aids owls in finding mates</p>
<p>or announcing their presence to potential competitors, and also</p>
<p>aids ornithologists and birders in locating these birds and </p>
<p>distinguishing species. As noted above, their facial discs help </p>
<p>owls to funnel the sound of prey to their ears. In many ,</p>
<p>these discs are placed asymmetrically, for better directional</p>
<p>location. Owl plumage is generally cryptic, although several </p>
<p>species have facial and head markings, including face masks,</p>
<p>ear tufts, and brightly colored irises. These markings are</p>
<p>generally more common in species inhabiting open habitats,</p>
<p>and are thought to be used in signaling with other owls in </p>
<p>low-light conditions.[11]



<h2>communication issues</h2>



<p>Almost all owls are listed in Appendix II of the international </p>
<p>CITES treaty (the Convention on Illegal Trade in Endangered </p>
<p>Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) with four species listed in</p>
<p>Appendix I. Although owls have long been hunted, a 2008 news </p>
<p>story from Malaysia indicates that the magnitude of owl </p>
<p>poaching may be on the rise. In November 2008, TRAFFIC reported </p>
<p>the seizure of 900 plucked and "oven-ready" owls in Peninsular </p>
<p>Malaysia. Said Chris Shepherd, Senior Programme Officer for </p>
<p>TRAFFIC's Southeast Asia office, "This is the first time we</p>
<p>know of where 'ready-prepared' owls have been seized in</p>
<p>Malaysia, and it may mark the start of a new trend in wild</p>
<p>meat from the region. We will be monitoring developments</p>
<p>closely." TRAFFIC commended the Department of Wildlife and</p>
<p>National Parks in Malaysia for the raid that exposed the huge</p>
<p>haul of owls. Included in the seizure were dead and plucked</p>
<p>barn owls, spotted wood owls, crested serpent eagles, barred</p>
<p>eagles, and brown wood owls, as well as 7,000 live lizards.[83]</p>
<p>In addition to hunting, other threats to owl populations are </p>
<p>habitat loss, pesticides, viruses, and vehicle collisions.[84][85]</p>
