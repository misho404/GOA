        <h1>GTA5</h1>
       <p><u><b>Theft Auto V </u></b> is a <i>2013</i> action-adventure game developed by <i> North</i> and published 
       <br>by Rockstar Games. It is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's 
       <br> Grand Theft Auto IV, and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, 
       <br>based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists—retired bank robber 
       <br> <u>Michael De Santa</u> (Ned Luke), street gangster <u>Franklin Clinton</u> (Shawn Fonteno), and drug dealer and gunrunner 
       <br> <u>Trevor Philips</u> (Steven Ogg)—and their attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government 
       <br>agency and powerful criminals. Players freely roam San Andreas's open world countryside and fictional city of 
       <br>Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.</p>
