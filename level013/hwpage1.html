    <p>   must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. </p>
    <p>   Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built </p>
    <p>   circuits or closed roads.A points scoring system is used at Grands Prix to determine two </p>
    <p>   annual World Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors—now synonymous</p>
    <p>   with teams. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing </p>

    <p>   rating the FIA issues for tracks.Formula One cars are the world's fastest regulated </p>
    <p>   road-course racing cars, owing to high cornering speeds achieved by generating large </p>
    <p>   amounts of aerodynamic downforce, most of which is generated by front and rear wings, </p>
    <p>   as well as underbody tunnels. The cars depend on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, </p>
    <p>   and tyres. Traction control, launch control, automatic shifting, and other electronic </p>
